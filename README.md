	                   Readme for the SCDA method package
								version Dec. 18, 2016
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The package includes the MATLAB code of the SCDA method for fine-grained image retrieval.

The main / key parts of SCDA are included in this package, i.e., selection and aggregation.

You will find a demo 'imdb.mat' file for the CUB200 dataset. But you need to download the 
pre-trained VGG-16 model by yourself via http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/pretrained/.
